## ðŸ§  Software Support Analyst | Aspiring Customer Solutions Engineer | API Developer | Creative Thinker

Hi there! I'm currently working as a **Support Analyst at IDBS**, where I help solve complex technical issues for life sciences software users. I'm actively building **real-world API projects in Python and Flask** to deepen my backend development skills and showcase my ability to create tools that improve support operations.

ðŸ’¡ **Current Focus:**  
- Building practical **Flask API** projects inspired by my work in software support  
- Learning how to design clean, testable APIs and integrate automation where useful  
- Preparing for a transition into a **Customer Solutions Engineer (CSE)** role  

ðŸ§ª **Real-World Projects:**  
- Article Workflow Tracker API: Tracks publishing delays for support documentation, helping reduce turnaround times (modeled after a real internal initiative)  
- More in the worksâ€¦

ðŸŽ¯ **Long-Term Goals:**  
- Bridge my support experience with **solution architecture and engineering**  
- Grow into roles that combine **technical expertise with customer-facing problem solving**  
- Continue learning tools like **Python, SQL, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP)**  

ðŸŽº **Fun fact:** I'm also a **visual artist and jazz musician** â€” trumpet, drums, and guitar are my instruments of choice.
